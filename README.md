# Apollofy Web App

Client App for the Apollofy project.


### What is Apollophy?
The objective of the Apollofy product is to make a front-end using React technology. Users will be able to access the application to play songs uploaded by themselves or songs uploaded by other users.

### Why the name Apollofy?
There were two options: either call it Apollofy or Assemblerfy. And it seemed much more artistic to call him Apollofy. Apollo is the Greek god of the arts, of truth, of beauty, of harmony and of reason. How many times will we need the favor of the god Apollo to achieve order and balance in the development of the project!

### Project management
The success of a software project does not only depend on good code quality. The alignment of the squad and the correct distribution of tasks and delivery dates is essential for complete success. For this reason, it is important that the project is correctly separated into small tasks that can be distributed among the different members of the squad, and that these are gradually completed throughout the weeks of the project.
